Once upon a time, there lived an ugly barnacle on the underbelly of
a pirate ship. Wherever the ship went, he went. He was so ugly, that
everyone who saw him died. He was the pirates' secret weapon.

When the pirate ship sank during a battle, the barnacle sunk too. At
the bottom of the ocean he made friends with another barnacle. They
made a plan to conquer the planet and rule the world together.
