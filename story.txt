Once upon a time, there lived an ugly barnacle on the underbelly of
a pirate ship. Wherever the ship went, he went. He was so ugly, that
everyone who saw him died. He was the pirates' secret weapon.

When the pirate ship sank during a battle, the barnacle sunk too. At
the bottom of the ocean he made friends with another barnacle. They
made a plan to conquer the planet and rule the world together.

"How the heck did the other barnicle not die?" you may be asking.
This other, non-ugly barnicle was blind, so he was immune to the 
ugliness of the ugly barnicle. He did however, use echolocation, so
he could get around just fine.
