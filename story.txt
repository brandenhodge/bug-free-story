Once upon a time, there lived an ugly barnacle on the underbelly of
a pirate ship. Wherever the ship went, he went. He was so ugly, that
everyone who saw him died. He was the pirates' secret weapon.

When the pirate ship sank during a battle, the barnacle sunk too. At
the bottom of the ocean he made friends with another barnacle. They
made a plan to conquer the planet and rule the world together.

"How the heck did the other barnicle not die?" you may be asking.
This other, non-ugly barnicle was blind, so he was immune to the 
ugliness of the ugly barnicle. He did however, use echolocation, so
he could get around just fine.

The plan was to gather all of the barnacles in the world together to form a team
called "Super Barnacles." Within the team, each baracle has their own unique power. Some of them are blind as the non-ugly barnacle as they have the ability to use echolocation. Some of them are so ugly that people will not only die by seeing them, but people will also get poisoned by the body smell that these barnacles have.

With the power of globalization, the Super Barnacles grew and spread like wildfire. The ocean was lost to the barnacles.
But until the Super Barnacles evolve to grow feet, or until sea levels rise, humanity has time
to turn the tide, find their weaknesses, and take back the seas.
